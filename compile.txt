First you need to install development packages:

  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming/Installation/Linux
  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming/Installation/Windows  # for MinGW or MSys

To compile an example, go to its directory and just type:

  cd tut01/
  make

It will create an executable (such as 'triangle', 'cube' or 'teapot')
that you can run:

  ./triangle

You can compile all examples in one go by calling "make" in the top level
directory.
